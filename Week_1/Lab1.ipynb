    "### UDP\n",
    "UDP is an internet protocol. IT is connectionless and unreliable (yet quite fast). Although TCP is quite reliable and assures data delivery (even with certain delay), such features impose significant burden on the protocol which means greater latency and slower performance. UDP's importance is clear as it is crucial for streaming services and real-time applications where certains packets lost in the process do not affect the overall quality.\n",
    "#### UDP Header\n",
    "UDP's header is quite simple: \n",
    "* Source port: the port of the sender's host\n",
    "* Destination port: the port of the receiver's host\n",
    "* Length: a field to save the acual length of the UDP datagram\n",
    "* Checksum: As there is no error handling mechanisms in UDP, the latter is not mandatory. IP and ICMP are used for error reporting/handling"
